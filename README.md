# Developers-Hub-Internship
It was a great learning opportunity to enhance my web application security skills using real-world tools and secure coding practices.

Overview
This repository contains my completed tasks for the Developer’s Hub Cybersecurity Internship, focused on identifying and mitigating common web application vulnerabilities using a Node.js-based app (NodeGoat).

What I Learned:
This internship provided hands-on experience with real-world web application security practices. I learned to:

Identify vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP ZAP and Nmap

Fix XSS and input validation issues using the validator library

Secure passwords with bcrypt

Implement JWT token-based authentication

Protect HTTP headers using Helmet.js

Enable logging with Winston

Document findings and enforce best practices through a simple security checklist

Key Security Measures Implemented:
✅ Input validation & sanitization (validator)

✅ Password hashing (bcrypt)

✅ JWT authentication (jsonwebtoken)

✅ HTTP header protection (helmet)

✅ Logging with winston (security.log)

✅ Penetration testing with Nmap & browser tools

Contents:
server.js – Secured backend with logging and headers

session.js – Enhanced authentication with JWT & validation

security.log – Logged application events (screenshots attached in week3 pdf)

checklist.md – Final security checklist (in week3 pdf)

Final Thoughts:
This was a great learning opportunity to practically apply web application security techniques and build a stronger understanding of defensive programming.
